Compile with "javac Client.java" and "javac Server.java"
Run with "java Server" and "java Client"
Server needs to be running first. If done incorrectly, client will display error message and terminate.
Only one instance of Server can be running,however, multiple Clients can connect simultaneously.
Use "quit" to disconnect and terminate clients.
